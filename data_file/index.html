		<p>This page shows how to transfer a file via WebRTC datachannels.</p>
		<p>To accomplish this in an interoperable way, the file is split into chunks which are then transferred via the datachannel. The datachannel is reliable and ordered by default which is well-suited to filetransfers.</p>
		<p>Send and receive progress is monitored using HTML5 <i>progress</i> elements.</p>
		<p>At the receiver, the file is reassembled using the Blob API and made available for download.</p>
